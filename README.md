# 1. Data Processing
- Cytokine Data Processing: Used variance stabalizing normalization (VSN) to normalize the data
- mRNA Data Processing: Averaged any replicates, applied VSN, and imputed missing data using the Quantile Regression Imputation of Left-Censored (QRILC) technique

# 2. Biomarker Friedman Analysis (Table S2-S5)
- Testing for statistical differences across burn conditions (control, smoldering, and flaming) for each individual biomarker (mRNAs or cytokines) within low (1ug/cm2) and high (25ug/cm2) doses after various exposure durations (4, 24, or 72 hours)
- Used a Friedman's test (non-parametric test for 3+ group comparisons) followed by Nemenyi's post hoc tests

# 3. Biomarker Cluster Analysis (Figures 4,5,7)
- Using Principal Component Analysis (PCA) to determine if and how exposure groups cluster based upon gene expression
- Using hierarchical clustering in heatmap visualizations to determine if and how genes cluster based upon abundance across exposure groups

# 4. Significant Biomarkers Visualization (Figure 6)
- Venn diagrams to visualize significant (p value < 0.1) gene expression modulations across exposure groups at the higher dose (25 ug/cm^2)

# 5. Correlation Analysis (Figure 8)
- Determining correlations between cytokine and PAHs using Spearman's rank correlation tests
